When coffee berries turn from green to bright red in color - indicating ripeness - they are picked, processed, and dried. The seeds are then roasted to varying degrees, depending on the desired flavor, before being ground and brewed to create coffee.\n\nThe two most commonly grown species of coffee plants are Coffea arabica and Coffea canephora (also known as Coffea robusta). Arabica coffee tends to have a sweeter, more complex flavor, while robusta coffee has a stronger, harsher taste and contains more caffeine.\n\nCoffee is a complex mixture of over 1,000 chemicals, including caffeine, acids, sugars, proteins, and oils. Roasting brings out these different flavor compounds. Brewing coffee releases the flavors, acids, and aromas trapped inside the bean. Popular brewing methods include drip coffee, French press, and espresso.\n\nThe origins of coffee date back to at least the 15th century in the highlands of Yemen. Today it is one of the most popular drinks in the world, with over 2.25 billion cups consumed daily. The coffee industry employs over 26 million people worldwide."]}}],"links":[],"resource":{"attributes":{"service.name":"bedrock.app"}}}
